  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>ApiaryAI offers a one-time in-app purchase to unlock all premium features.  
  All purchases are processed through the <strong>Apple App Store</strong> or <strong>Google Play Store</strong> and are subject to the refund policies of those platforms.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Apple App Store Refunds</h2>
  <p>If you made your purchase through the Apple App Store, you must request a refund directly from Apple.  
  Apple handles all transactions and refund requests independently of ApiaryAI.</p>

  <p><strong>To request a refund:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank">https://reportaproblem.apple.com</a></li>
    <li>Sign in with your Apple ID</li>
    <li>Locate the purchase and follow the instructions to request a refund</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Google Play Store Refunds</h2>
  <p>If you made your purchase through Google Play:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You may be eligible for a refund if requested within 48 hours</li>
    <li>Visit <a href="https://play.google.com/store/account" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/account</a></li>
    <li>Click "Order History"</li>
    <li>Locate the item and choose "Request a refund"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Google processes all payments and refunds on their own terms.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>No Direct Refunds</h2>
  <p>As a developer, we do <strong>not have access</strong> to your payment information or the ability to issue direct refunds.  
  All requests must be handled through Apple or Google per their respective policies.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Need Help?</h2>
  <p>If you're having trouble accessing premium features after purchase, or you believe a purchase was made in error, please email us at:</p>
  <p><strong>ðŸ“§ danielnajda@danielnajda.com</strong></p>

  <p>Weâ€™re happy to help you resolve the issue within the app, even though refunds are handled by the app stores.</p>
